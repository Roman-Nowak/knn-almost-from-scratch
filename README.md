# GENERAL INFO ABOUT THE PROJECT
* I decided to implement the k-Nearest Neighbors classifier to learn how it works under the hood.
* This is the first iteration of the project.
* It includes a naive implementation of knn.
* I want to add k-d tree and balltree later to improve the project.

# PURPOSE OF THE PROJECT
* The purpose of the project is educational. I want this repo to be a good resource for others.
* The jupyter notebook also includes a short intro to supervised learning


# RESOURCES
* The plot and the preparation of the data are taken from here: https://python-course.eu/machine-learning/k-nearest-neighbor-classifier-in-python.php
* k-d tree, ball tree: https://towardsdatascience.com/tree-algorithms-explained-ball-tree-algorithm-vs-kd-tree-vs-brute-force-9746debcd940

# TO DO
* ~~make the output prettier~~
* k-d tree
* ball tree
* implement model evaluation
* rewrite it in the oop paradigm
